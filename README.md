# Personify

A personalized playlist generator based on users' moods and activities

## Inspiration

As avid music listeners, we wanted to solve a problem that we constantly faced and didn't have a solution for.

## What it does

Personify is a web app built to take into consideration user preferences such as mood, favorite artists (or artists they are currently interested in), and genre to create a personalized playlist based on their current preferences.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

The challenges we faced during the project were extensive, we had trouble calling our APIs, authentication issues, token issues, front end development issues, and issues with choosing an overall design theme.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to create a functioning product that met our project goals.

## What we learned

We all felt like we learned a lot from this experience, we got a much better understanding of what it's like to work collaboratively on a project, we got to learn APIs we have never used prior to the hackathon, and we learned how to think about more out of the box solutions.

## What's next for Personify

That is to be determined! There is a lot of cool things that we can add to it and may continue this project moving forward. We'd hope to expand on a lot of the features, be able to store generated playlists, and fine tuning the algorithm.
